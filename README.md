# auction-algorithm-simulations
This repository is for my 4th year assignment.

Name: Jonathan Board

My 4th year project is a research based project rather than a traditional one.  I chose to dive deep into the world of auctions and the algorithms that lay underneath them. 
The body of my research is in my dissertation which is located in pdf format in this repo.  Going along with my dissertation I have a auction simulator created using Python, Jinja2, and Bootstrap.  

  How to run:
  1. clone into repository via console
  2. cd into the directory src auction-algorithm-simulations\auction_sim
  3. enter flask run to start the program
  4. In the console it should display a location where the server is running on.(usually this is http://127.0.0.1:5000 but you can just enter via console link)
  5. The main menu should pop up in browser. If not then open your web browser and manually enter the location link that is shown in your console.

Analysis:

While the auction is simulating you are presented with the bidders information (max-bid, bidding style),
bidding status, and the live bidding history.
